# CI-reachability guard (#lzcheckcireachguard).
#
# Fails the build when `make check` runs a gate that CI never reaches. That is the
# drift this guard exists for: someone adds a target to `check`, it passes locally
# forever, and no CI job ever executes it — which is exactly how #lzinteroppeerci
# happened. The interop peer, the single cross-binding wire-compatibility gate, was
# in every binding's `check` and in no binding's workflow, for months.
#
# It also exists because the obvious hand-audit is WRONG. Grepping the workflows
# for "make check" reported all nine bindings as covered; every one of those hits
# was a COMMENT. Comments are the reason this is a script and not a convention:
# only `run:` bodies count here, and comment lines inside them are stripped before
# anything is matched.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES
#
#   For every target in `check`'s prerequisite closure, at least one CI `run:`
#   step invokes the same program with the same distinguishing flags.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE
#
#   That CI runs it against the same inputs, in the same environment, or that the
#   command means the same thing there. Reach is a floor, not equivalence. The
#   sibling guards (conformance-coverage, assertion-keys, scenario-coverage) are
#   what prove a run examined anything.
#
# HOW A TARGET IS MATCHED
#
#   Recipes are read through `make -n`, so make variables are already expanded and
#   we compare real command lines rather than source text. `make -p` is
#   deliberately NOT used: it dumps the entire environment to stdout, which would
#   print every secret in the job's env into the CI log.
#
#   Each command is split on the shell's sequencing operators, redirections are
#   dropped, and the remainder is reduced to an ANCHOR: the program basename plus
#   its subcommands and flag NAMES (values dropped), with path arguments reduced to
#   basenames and bare path globs discarded. A target is reached when EVERY one of
#   its anchors is a subsequence of some CI command's token list, or when CI runs
#   `make <target>` directly. Every, not any: a target that runs two gates and is
#   half-covered by CI is a gap, and "any" would report it green.
#
#   Keeping flag names in the anchor is what makes the guard falsifiable rather
#   than decorative: `go test -race` does not match a CI step that only runs
#   `go test -count=1`, so dropping the race job reddens this guard instead of
#   being absorbed by the plain test job.
#
#   An argument that is still a VARIABLE reference at this point — `$MANIFEST` in
#   a CI step, or a `$$VAR` a recipe leaves for the shell — names a value the
#   guard cannot resolve, so it becomes a WILDCARD matching exactly one token on
#   the other side (#lzcireachvaranchor). Make and CI routinely spell the same
#   path differently, one through an expanded `$(VAR)` and the other through the
#   environment, and they are the same command. Dropping the token instead, which
#   is what this used to do, lost the argument as well as its value and reported
#   a step that genuinely ran the gate as unreachable — a false RED that cost one
#   binding a hardcoded second spelling of the path plus a hand-written equality
#   assertion, which is a new drift surface invented to satisfy a guard whose job
#   is detecting drift. Arity still counts: `script.sh $A` does not match a CI
#   step that passes no argument at all.
#
#   Commands whose program is a shell builtin or a plain file/text utility carry no
#   gate, so they contribute no anchor. A target with no non-trivial command at all
#   (a mkdir-only reset step, say) is reported as carrying no gate and is not
#   required to appear in CI. It cannot fail a build, so it cannot hide one.
#
# THE EXCUSE LIST IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE DELIVERABLE
#
#   scripts/ci-reach.conf names the workflows that count and the targets that are
#   deliberately local-only, each with a reason. It is the one place a reader can
#   see what this binding does not enforce in CI, in the same spirit as
#   KNOWN_UNCOVERED. Excuses are checked in BOTH directions: an excused target that
#   CI turns out to reach fails too, so the list cannot rot into a list of things
#   that used to be true.

# --------------------------------------------- the dry run must be readable AT ALL
#
# Everything below reads recipe lines out of `make -n`, and every one of those
# reads discards make's stderr (`2>/dev/null`) because make's own `make[1]:`
# chatter would otherwise be scraped as recipe text. So this one invocation runs
# FIRST, in the main shell, with stderr LEFT ALONE: if the dry run cannot be
# produced, the operator gets make's actual sentence here rather than this
# script's paraphrase of it from inside a command substitution.
#
# This probe is DIAGNOSTIC, not the catch, and that distinction was measured
# rather than assumed (#lzgrepcpipefail). The per-target refusal in the closure
# walk below catches every case this one does: with this block deleted, a scratch
# copy of this Makefile carrying `test-shm: nonexistent.stamp` -- the ordinary
# shape of a half-finished edit -- still exits 1 and lists `check` and `test-shm`
# as unreadable. What this block adds is make's OWN sentence
# (`No rule to make target 'nonexistent.stamp', needed by 'test-shm'`), printed
# once, up front, instead of this script's paraphrase arriving after fifty more
# `make -n` invocations.
#
# It is NOT sufficient on its own, which was also measured: `make -n check` can
# exit 0 while `make -n <one member>` exits 2 (see the goal-conditional attack
# documented at the per-target refusal), and against that this probe passes
# silently while a target drops out of the reached count. Root and per-target
# cover different failures; neither replaces the other.
#
# What the unfixed script did with an unreadable recipe was measured too:
# `no gate  test-shm  recipe runs no checkable command`, then
# `check-ci-reach: OK -- 49 target(s) reached by CI, 0 excused, 3 carrying no
# gate`, at exit 0. The target carrying the shm and blob-backend rungs stopped
# being required to appear in CI, the reached count fell 50 -> 49, and the words
# "make" and "No rule" appeared nowhere. lazily-py, zig, gd, cs and js each
# reproduced the same drop-out in their own closures.
#
# TODAY'S Makefile cannot reach the missing-prerequisite form: every prerequisite
# of `check` is a .PHONY recipe-bearing rule with no prerequisites of its own and
# there is no `$(MAKE)` recursion anywhere, so `make -n <any target>` works for
# all of them or for none. That is a property of the file this guard exists to
# watch, which is exactly the kind of property not to depend on -- and the
# goal-conditional form does not need even that much, since it leaves the root
# dry run exiting 0.
