# runner already bound, so a block NO runner binds reports nothing: its keys are
# not unread, nothing reads them. The loader inventories every `assertions`

# ONE run id per `make` invocation (#lzstalemanifest). Every guard over the three
# ledgers above asserts "these bytes were really read", which is a claim about
# THIS invocation, and nothing in those files said which invocation wrote them.
#
# `cargo` cannot produce the lazily-kt failure — it caches COMPILATION, never
# test execution, so a `cargo test` step always re-runs its binaries, and
# `conformance-manifest-reset` truncates all three ledgers before the suite, so a
# skipped step would leave them EMPTY, which every guard already fails on. The
# exposed path is the guard invoked ALONE: `make conformance-coverage` with no
# suite ahead of it reads whatever the last `make check` left.
#
# So the first test process to write each truncated ledger stamps
# `# lazily-run-id <value>` as its first line, and the guards require it to equal
# this value. An unset run id makes them REFUSE rather than skip.
#
# It MUST be simply-expanded: `?=` and `=` are recursive, so `$(shell ...)` would
# re-run at every reference and hand the stamp and the guard different ids — a
# failure that is closed but baffling. `origin` rather than `?=` so CI (which
# passes `${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}` in the job env) can
