//! CRDT-backed multi-write cells (#lazilycrdtrs).
//!
//! This module implements the **first multi-write merge mechanism** of the
//! lazily cell model (`lazily-spec/cell-model.md`): `merge: crdt`. The cell
//! model classifies every cell by concurrent-writer count —
//!
//! - **single-writer** (`local`/`direct`): exactly one writer, no merge — the
//!   ordinary [`Context::cell`](crate::Context::cell);
//! - **multi-write**: potentially many concurrent writers, converged by a
//!   pluggable `merge: <mechanism>` ingress on **root cells only**.
//!
//! `crdt` is the first mechanism defined (it converges without coordination);
//! [`MergeMechanism`] reserves `lww`/`ot`/`lease`/`custom` alongside it. A
//! [`ReplicatedCell`] is a multi-write **root** cell whose remote-op ingress
//! merge feeds the converged value into an ordinary reactive cell via
//! [`Context::set_cell`](crate::Context::set_cell). Everything downstream is
//! unchanged: derived slots recompute through the normal direct mechanism, and
//! the local `PartialEq` invalidation guard applies *after* merge — a merge
//! that yields an equal value invalidates nothing, exactly like a local equal
//! `set_cell`. Derived cells are never multi-write; effects stay single-writer
//! authority (see `SPEC.md` § Multi-writer coordination).
//!
//! The CRDT register types here (LWW / MV / PN) are the value shapes available
//! *within* `merge: crdt`; they are distinct from the [`MergeMechanism`] axis.
//! All three merges are commutative, associative, and idempotent, so replicas
//! converge regardless of delivery order or duplication.
