//! Reactive queue: [`QueueCell`] + pluggable [`QueueStorage`] backend (#lzqueue).
//!
//! A `QueueCell<T>` is a FIFO collection composed of reactive cells — **not a
//! new cell kind** — that adds queue semantics (push to tail, pop from head) to
//! the reactive graph. It is specified as a **single-producer, single-consumer
//! (SPSC)** primitive; **MPSC** (multi-producer) is a *usage rule* on the same
//! primitive — multiple producers push inside a [`Context::batch`] boundary, and
//! the batch serializes the pushes into a deterministic order. There is no
//! separate `MPSCQueueCell` type (`lazily-spec/cell-model.md` § "QueueCell —
//! SPSC primitive with MPSC usage rule").
//!
//! ## Shell vs storage
//!
//! The reactive shell owns the reader-kinds (`head` / `len` / `is_empty` /
//! `is_full` as demand-driven Slots, `closed` as a Cell) and the invalidation
//! logic; it is storage-agnostic. The storage backend owns the actual FIFO data
//! structure and is pluggable via [`QueueStorage`], whose **minimal required
//! contract** is `try_push` / `try_pop` / `len` / `is_closed` / `close`
//! (`peek`/`capacity` are optional capabilities). The default [`VecDequeStorage`] is an
//! unbounded ring buffer; a bounded variant exposes reactive backpressure via
//! `is_full`. A distributed backend (`RaftQueueStorage`, future work per the
//! distributed-queue PRD) or an external-broker adapter (`KafkaStorage`, etc.)
//! plugs into the same reactive shell.
//!
//! ## Reader-kind invalidation
//!
//! Invalidation is scoped to **reader kind**, not to individual positions. A
//! push invalidates `len` / `is_empty` readers (and `head` when transitioning
//! from empty, and `is_full` when transitioning to capacity); a pop invalidates
//! `head` / `len` / `is_empty` readers (and `is_full` when transitioning off
//! capacity). The head reader observes the *current* head value — after a pop,
//! the head reader sees the next element (or `None`), not a stale value.
//!
//! Reader-kinds are **demand-driven derived Slots**, not eagerly-`Set` cells
//! (`relaycell-backpressure-analysis.md` §5 — a derived reader *is* a Slot). A
//! successful push/pop does not derive any reader value; it only invalidates the
//! Slots whose value **provably changed**, computed from the op plus the pre-op
//! `len()` (exact for any FIFO backend — no `peek` needed to decide):
//!
//! - `len` — every successful push/pop;
//! - `is_empty` — push-to-empty or pop-to-empty;
//! - `is_full` — push-to-capacity or pop-off-capacity (bounded backend only);
//! - `head` — every pop, or push-to-empty.
//!
//! Each reader's value is derived lazily from storage on first `Get` after
//! invalidation and memoized until the next relevant transition. This gives
//! reader-kind independence (a push to a non-empty queue never touches the `head`
//! Slot) without deriving anything eagerly: an **unsubscribed** `QueueCell`
//! collapses toward raw-storage cost per op (the reactive shell is charged only
//! along a path an effect actually observes — the merge cost law, §4.0), while a
//! subscribed reader stays glitch-free because the transitioning Slots are
//! invalidated together in one frontier walk ([`Context::clear_slots`]).
//!
//! ## Closure, bounded backpressure, ordering
//!
//! - **Closure** is an observable contract: pop on closed+non-empty drains;
//!   pop on closed+empty returns [`QueuePopError::Closed`] (distinct from
//!   [`QueuePopError::Empty`]); push on closed is an error; close is idempotent
//!   and terminal.
//! - **Bounded backpressure**: when the backend is bounded, `is_full` is a
//!   reactive read. A consumer's pop that transitions full → not-full
//!   invalidates `is_full` readers (true → false), enabling push-side effects to
//!   react to capacity recovery without polling.
//! - **Ordering**: SPSC gives total FIFO (pop order exactly matches push order).
//!   MPSC gives per-producer FIFO; inter-producer interleaving is deterministic
//!   within a `batch()` but the cross-batch order is batch-sequential.
//!
//! ```
//! use lazily::{Context, QueueCell};
//!
//! let ctx = Context::new();
//! let q: QueueCell<&'static str> = QueueCell::new(&ctx);
//!
//! // SPSC: total FIFO.
//! q.try_push(&ctx, "a").unwrap();
//! q.try_push(&ctx, "b").unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(q.head(&ctx), Some("a"));
//! assert_eq!(q.len(&ctx), 2);
//!
//! assert_eq!(q.try_pop(&ctx).unwrap(), "a");
//! assert_eq!(q.try_pop(&ctx).unwrap(), "b");
//! assert!(q.is_empty(&ctx));
//!
//! // MPSC: multiple producers push inside one batch → one invalidation pass.
//! ctx.batch(|ctx| {
//!     q.try_push(ctx, "p1-a").unwrap();
//!     q.try_push(ctx, "p2-a").unwrap();
//!     q.try_push(ctx, "p1-b").unwrap();
//! });
//! assert_eq!(q.len(&ctx), 3);
//! ```
//!
//! See `lazily-spec/cell-model.md` § "Reactive queues" for the full spec, and
//! `lazily-spec/docs/distributed-queue-prd.md` for the future consensus-backed
//! `RaftQueueStorage` backend.

/// (unbounded `VecDeque`); future backends include `RaftQueueStorage` (embedded
/// consensus, per the distributed-queue PRD) and `KafkaStorage` /
/// `RedisStreamStorage` / `SqsStorage` (external-broker adapters).
///
/// # Conformance
///
/// **Minimal required contract** — a conforming backend MUST implement exactly:
/// [`try_push`](QueueStorage::try_push), [`try_pop`](QueueStorage::try_pop),
/// [`len`](QueueStorage::len), [`is_closed`](QueueStorage::is_closed), and
/// [`close`](QueueStorage::close). [`peek`](QueueStorage::peek) and
/// [`capacity`](QueueStorage::capacity) are **optional capabilities** with
/// default impls returning `None`; a raw channel that satisfies only the five
/// required methods is fully conforming (it simply has no `head`/`is_full`
/// reader). A conforming backend MUST also:
///
/// 1. **FIFO order** — `try_pop` returns elements in `try_push` order.
/// 2. **Cardinality compatibility** — its native producer/consumer shape is a
///    superset of the shell's required shape (SPSC shell = any backend; MPSC
///    usage requires a multi-writer backend).
/// 3. **Bounded contract (optional)** — a bounded backend overrides
///    [`capacity`](QueueStorage::capacity) to return `Some(n)` and `try_push`
///    returns [`Full`](QueuePushError::Full) at capacity. The overflow policy is
///    a backend property. An unbounded backend uses the default `None`.
/// 4. **Position identity** — invalidation is phrased over reader kind, not
///    storage indices. A ring-buffer backend whose slot index wraps MUST NOT
///    cause spurious invalidations; the shell layers its own demand-driven
///    reader-kind Slots above the storage.
//
// `is_empty` is deliberately NOT on this trait: emptiness is a shell-level
// reader kind, not a storage property (the shell derives `is_empty` from
// `len()`). See `lazily-spec/cell-model.md` § "Storage backend contract".
