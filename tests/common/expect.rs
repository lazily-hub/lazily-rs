//! Assertion-key consumption *and assertion* guard (`#lzassertunknownkeys`,
//! `#lzconsumednotasserted`).
//!
//! # The failure this closes
//!
//! `tests/common/mod.rs` proves a fixture was *opened*. That is one level above
//! the defect this module exists for: having opened and replayed a fixture, did
//! the runner actually **consume** the keys the fixture asserts?
//!
//! Every conformance runner in this repo reads its assertion block by name —
//! `step["expected"]["invalidates"]["value"]`, `sc["expect"]["final_last_epoch"]`
//! — and `serde_json::Value`'s `Index` returns `Value::Null` for a key that is
//! not there. So a key the runner does not know about is not an error; it is
//! invisible. The fixture round-trips, the suite goes green, and the one thing
//! the fixture exists to pin is never checked.
//!
//! This was found concretely in lazily-kt: `delta_zero_copy_arrow.json` carries a
//! `backend` discriminator that `assertAssertions` never read, so the fixture
//! would have been "replayed" while never testing the backend. Adding the missing
//! arm fixed that instance and not the property. Worse, a corpus assertion key
//! that *no* binding implements would be skipped in all nine at once, with
//! nothing anywhere reporting it.
//!
//! # Reading is not asserting (`#lzconsumednotasserted`)
//!
//! Recording a *read* proves consumption. It does not prove assertion. A runner
//! can read a key and discard it, and the guard above stays green. Three shapes
//! do this:
//!
//! 1. a named skip inside a loop that consumes the block — the read marks the key,
//!    then `continue` steps past the comparison;
//! 2. a value bound and never compared — `let want = exp["x"];` and nothing after;
//! 3. a comparison against a *literal* rather than the fixture value, so editing
//!    the fixture changes nothing.
//!
//! So [`Expect`] tracks a second set. A key becomes **asserted** only by passing
//! through [`Expect::assert_key`] (fixture value vs actual, compared here) or
//! [`Expect::assert_key_with`] (fixture value handed to the caller's own check,
//! for tolerances, containment, and shapes `Value` equality cannot express). A
//! literal-comparison arm never reaches either, so it never marks the key.
//!
//! The drop check therefore has three failure modes:
//!
//! | mode | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | never read | the fixture asserts something the runner does not know about |
//! | read but not asserted | the runner looked at the key and discarded it |
//! | stale excuse | a key is both excused *and* asserted, so the excuse hides nothing |
//!
//! # The ladder
//!
//! `#lzcoverageaudit` proves the fixture was opened. `#lzassertunknownkeys`
//! proves every key was read. This module's second set proves every read key
//! reached a comparison against the fixture's own value.
//!
//! # The seam
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let exp = Expect::new(&path, format!("steps[{i}].expected"), &step["expected"]);
//! exp.assert_key("value", cell.value(&ctx));
//! exp.sub("invalidates").assert_key("value", invalidated);
//! // `exp` drops here; an unconsumed *or* unasserted key panics.
//! ```
//!
//! It is deliberately *observational*: only a key the runner really compared
//! counts. A declared list of "keys this runner handles" would go stale the same
//! way the static coverage grep did — it proves a spelling, not a comparison.
//!
//! # Depth policy
//!
//! [`Expect::sub`] descends one level and guards the nested object too; the
//! parent key is satisfied *structurally*, because the child's own drop check
//! now owns every key beneath it. [`Expect::get`] marks a key read and hands back
//! the raw subtree — it is the escape hatch for a value that drives a code path
//! rather than one that is compared, and on its own it is now a **failure**
//! unless the same key is also asserted or excused.
//!
//! Descend with `sub` wherever the nested keys are themselves *assertion names*
//! (`invalidates`, `final_state`, `after_publish`, per-record expectations); use
//! `assert_key`/`assert_key_with` where the nested object is *data* whose keys
//! are ids, peer names, or map entries the runner compares wholesale. Guarding
//! data keys would report a fixture's payload as an unconsumed assertion, which
//! is noise, not a finding.
//!
//! # Object-valued keys must be checked by their KEY SET (`#lzsubblockkeyset`)
//!
//! Everything above is about the keys of a *block*. An assertion key whose VALUE
//! is itself a JSON object has the same defect one level down: a runner that
//! compares five named sub-fields and stops leaves a sixth, added upstream,
//! compared by nothing. This is the null form **inside** an assertion key rather
//! than beside one, and no rung above can see it — the parent key is read,
//! asserted, and consumed, so every guard reports clean.
//!
//! Found by the `#lznullformblind` perturbation pass in lazily-zig: planting a
//! key inside `arena_blob.json`'s `assertions.descriptor` left the suite green
//! while every scalar sibling reddened.
//!
//! The cheap fix is a field count at each call site, and it is the wrong one —
//! it holds only while every site remembers. So the TRACKER holds an
//! object-valued key's key set the way it already holds the block's. Three
//! entry points satisfy the obligation:
//!
//! | entry point | how the key set is checked |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`Expect::sub`] | the child tracker owns every key beneath, so an unrecognised sub-key is an unconsumed key |
//! | [`Expect::assert_key_set`] | the fixture's key set compared, both directions, against the set the run produced |
//! | [`Expect::assert_key`] / [`Expect::assert_key_at`] | whole-`Value` equality subsumes key-set equality — a planted key changes the object |
//!
//! and [`Expect::check`] FAILS at drop for any object-valued key consumed
//! through [`Expect::assert_key_with`], [`Expect::assert_key_if_present`] or a
//! bare [`Expect::get`] without one of the three. That is the whole point: a
//! call site that reaches for the opaque entry point on an object value gets a
//! red suite instead of a silent hole. The excuse and prose channels stay
//! available for a key that genuinely carries no key-set obligation, and both
//! already require a recorded reason.
//!
//! # Exceptions
//!
//! [`Expect::excuse_key`] marks a key satisfied without asserting it. It is for a
//! key that genuinely cannot be compared at this call site — the binding proves
//! the fact elsewhere, or the field is a discriminator selecting a code path
//! rather than a value to check. The reason is required and belongs at the call
//! site, where review can see it.
//!
//! It runs in **both directions**, exactly as the `KNOWN_UNCOVERED` allowlists
//! do: excusing a key the same run also asserts is a failure, because the excuse
//! has gone stale and is now hiding nothing.
//!
//! # Prose keys (`#lzprosekeyconvention`)
//!
//! An `assertions` block mixes two kinds of key. Most carry a value a runner can
//! compare against observed behaviour. A few carry an English paragraph that
//! states an obligation and nothing comparable — `clause`, `anti_vacuity`,
//! `null_form`, `theorem`, `note`. The corpus, not the binding, says which:
//! `assertions.prose` is an array of sibling key names, and because it is itself
//! a key of the block the guards above see it — a runner that ignores it fails
//! with an unconsumed key, which is what makes the convention self-enforcing.
//!
//! A prose key is **discharged**, never asserted and never excused. To discharge
//! it a runner names the executable assertion keys that carry its obligation:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! exp.prose_key("epoch_disambiguation", &["frame_epoch", "blob_epoch"]);
//! ```
//!
//! and the ledger checks the naming. That is the whole convention: the excuse
//! becomes falsifiable. "`epoch_disambiguation` is discharged by `frame_epoch`
//! and `blob_epoch`" is a claim about the run; "`epoch_disambiguation` is prose"
//! is not. The former `Expect::prose` — a third exempt state that required a
//! reason and then discarded it — is **deleted** rather than kept alongside; two
//! paths to satisfy one key is the ambiguity this closes.
//!
//! The ledger fails the run when:
//!
//! | # | failure |
//! |---|---|
//! | 1 | a key listed in `assertions.prose` is **asserted** |
//! | 2 | a key listed in `assertions.prose` is **excused** with free text |
//! | 3 | a key **not** listed in `assertions.prose` is discharged |
//! | 4 | the set of discharged keys differs from `assertions.prose` |
//! | 5 | a discharge names **no** keys |
//! | 6 | a discharge names a key the same fixture's run did not assert |
//! | 7 | a discharge names a key that is itself prose, **or names `prose`** |
//!
//! Rule 7's second half is not redundant: `prose` never lists itself, so the
//! prose-name set is SEEDED with `prose` — otherwise `discharged_by = ["prose"]`
//! slips past rule 7, and the rule-4 comparison is what marks `prose` asserted,
//! so rule 6 waves it through too. A paragraph discharged by the declaration
//! that it is a paragraph proves nothing.
//!
//! Rule 6 is why the NAME MATCHING is **fixture-wide**:
//! `epoch_disambiguation` is stated in `assertions` and discharged by
//! `expect.frame_epoch` / `expect.blob_epoch`, asserted long after the
//! `assertions` block has dropped. The DECLARATION is block-local, and so are
//! rules 3 and 4 — each block owns its own `prose` array. Verification happens
//! when the replay is finished — `expect::verify_prose(fixture)`, armed by a
//! [`ProseLedger`] guard whose own `Drop` fails a run that never verified. An
//! unverified claim is as bad as an unconsumed key. A "run" is ONE TEST, so the
//! ledger is cleared at each verification rather than unioning asserted keys
//! across tests.
//!
//! A discharge may name a key that carries the obligation only by PROXY, and two
//! in the corpus must: `wire_encoding` is a claim about how the corpus carries
//! its bytes, which no assertion a run makes can observe, and `theorem` names a
//! Lean theorem in another repository. Naming the closest executable keys is
//! conforming; naming a key with nothing to do with the obligation is not, and
//! no tracker can tell the two apart. That judgement stays with review, which is
//! why the discharge is written at the call site where review sees it — and why
//! each proxy says at that call site that it IS one.
//!
//! `note`, `description` and `reason` stay exempt **by name** in a block that
//! does not declare them prose — they are per-step and per-scenario annotations,
//! and the reactive-graph corpus carries ~97 of them. The declaration is
//! evaluated on the RAW block FIRST, before any name-based exemption: a tracker
//! that subtracts its reserved names first makes `frame_roundtrip_json`'s
//! declared `note` invisible — exempt from the unread guard, exempt from the
//! unasserted guard, never discharged — so the fixture skips the whole
//! convention while the binding still reports conforming. Two of the nine hit
//! that independently.
