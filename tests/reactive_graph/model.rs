//! The execution model abstraction for the reactive-graph conformance corpus
//! (`#lzspecedgeindex`).
//!
//! The corpus describes graph behaviour, not a particular context type, so the
//! runner is parameterised over the execution model rather than written against
//! `Context`. `lazily` ships three execution models and the disposal/teardown
//! contract must hold in all of them — leaks in the thread-safe and async paths
//! are the ones hardest to notice and hardest to reproduce, so those are
//! precisely the ones that need a contract to conform to.
//!
//! Implementations live next to the runner in `reactive_graph_conformance.rs`.
//!
//! ## Why the model builds the closures
//!
//! Trait methods take *data* (`reads`, `offset`, a name) rather than a closure.
//! Each execution model has different bounds on what a compute may capture —
//! `Context` requires only `'static`, `ThreadSafeContext` additionally requires
//! `Send + Sync`, and `AsyncContext` wants an async block — so building the
//! closure inside each impl keeps those bounds where they belong instead of
//! forcing the union of all three onto the runner.
//!
//! ## Why `read` is synchronous
//!
//! The async model blocks on its own runtime internally. Making the trait async
//! would drag an executor into the default-feature `Context` test, which has no
//! tokio dependency; pushing the blocking into the one model that needs it
//! keeps the engine executor-free.
