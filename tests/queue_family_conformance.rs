//! The queue-family reader-kind contract, replayed against **every flavor this
//! binding ships** — with a ledger that is *enforced* rather than advisory.
//!
//! lazily-rs now ships all nine: `QueueCell` / `TopicCell` / `WorkQueueCell` ×
//! single-threaded / thread-safe / async, matching the nine `coverage.json` rows
//! and the Core surface `cell-model.md` § "Core surface vs. binding extensions
//! (queue family)" declares REQUIRED of every binding × every flavor.
//!
//! The flavor axis lives in the **runner**, not the corpus: the fixtures carry a
//! `model` field naming the primitive and no execution-model field, and one
//! `TopicModel` / `WorkQueueModel` trait replays the same JSON against each
//! shell. Nothing in either trait is async-coloured, which is the finding rather
//! than an oversight — a queue's length, a subscription cursor, and a lease
//! decision all derive from storage the graph does not own, so there is nothing
//! to await and no `settle` step anywhere below.
//!
//! Three things keep this suite from reporting green while testing nothing —
//! each one a failure mode this family has actually shipped:
//!
//! * `unshipped_flavors_are_really_absent` greps `src/` for each flavor's type
//!   name, in **both** directions. A ledger row marked shipped whose type does
//!   not exist fails; a type that exists while its row says unshipped fails and
//!   names the runner to extend. The ledger cannot rot, because the filesystem
//!   enforces it. `shipped` must mean "the corpus runs against it" — flipping a
//!   flag without adding a replay is the exact false green this file exists to
//!   prevent.
//! * Every replay returns its step count and every flavor asserts that count is
//!   non-zero and plausible. An absence guard proves the fixtures exist on disk;
//!   only a positive count proves this binary opened them.
//! * `ledger_is_not_all_skips` fails if every flavor is unshipped, and pins the
//!   row count at nine, so a quietly-deleted row is a red test rather than
//!   silently narrowed coverage.
//!
//! Every gate below was mutation-checked: a deliberate defect (drop one
//! invalidation, unbatch a multi-root clear, reverse the redelivery order) turns
//! the owning flavor red. One probe did **not** discriminate on the first pass —
//! reversing `reap_expired`'s sort left the whole corpus green, because no
//! fixture step expires more than one lease at a time. That gap is closed by
//! `multi_expiry_requeues_in_delivery_order` rather than left as a green
//! assertion of nothing.
//!
//! Mirrors the shape of `collections_family_conformance.rs`, which closed the
//! same gap for `ReactiveMap`.
