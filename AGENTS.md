# lazily-rs

Lazy reactive primitives library for Rust.

## Commit & Push

Commit and push completed work at the end of every turn that changed code,
tests, docs, or fixtures — do not leave finished work uncommitted. Run `make
check` first and ensure it is green; stage only the files that belong to the
change (never secrets or private customer names — see the workspace
`runbooks/private-name-hygiene.md`); write a concise commit message in the
repo's existing style; push to the current branch on `origin`. This standing
rule overrides the harness default of "commit only when explicitly asked" for
this repo.

## Architecture

- `src/reactive_graph.rs` — capability traits over the three execution models (`#lzspecedgeindex`): bound-free `ReactiveGraph` (disposal, scopes, batch, degree introspection, associated `Computed`/`Source`/`Effect`/`Scope` types), `Teardown` (scope contract), `SyncReactiveGraph`/`AsyncReactiveGraph` (construction + reads, split by read discipline), and the blanket-implemented `ThreadSafeReactiveGraph` marker. Read discipline and thread-safety are orthogonal axes, hence four traits
- `src/context.rs` — `Context` struct, dependency graph, value-threaded tracking via the fortified `Compute` view (no thread-local tracking stack; `#lzcellkernel`)
- `src/cell.rs` — **the Cell kernel** (`#lzcellkernel`): `Cell` is a *conceptual* word (a value-bearing reactive node), not a type — there is **no `Cell<T, K>` genus struct**. The two kinds of cell are two concrete `Copy` handle structs (each a lightweight `SlotId` into Context): `Source<T, M = KeepLatest>` (source cell — written from outside, folds under policy `M`) and `Computed<T>` (computed cell — computed from upstream). The former `Source<M>` / `Formula` kind markers dissolve — `M` is now `Source`'s own policy param. Reads (`get`, `subscribe`, `dispose`) exist on both handles; writes (`set`, `merge`) exist **only** on `impl<T, M: MergePolicy<T>> Source<T, M>`, so `computed.set(…)` is a *"no method"* compile error (write protection without a trait, design §3). Computed lifecycle (`eager`/`lazy`/`is_eager`/`clear`/`get_rc`) is on `impl<T> Computed<T>`. Replaces the former `SlotHandle`/`CellHandle`/`SignalHandle`/`MergeCellHandle` structs (all deleted) and the vestigial `Reactive<T>`/`Source<T>` traits (deleted). Note `src/slot.rs` and `src/signal.rs` are gone — `Slot` survives only as the *storage* sense (`SlotId`, and the arena node struct `ComputedNode`/variant `Node::Computed` in `context.rs`; the source node is `SourceNode`/`Node::Source`)
- **Unified shared reads (`#lzrsgetarc`).** `Context::get_rc` and tracked `Compute::get_rc` accept either `Source` or `Computed` through `ReadRc`, return the same current value as `get` without requiring `T: Clone`, refresh computed values identically, and register the same dependency edge when tracked. This is the Rust spelling of the `Reactive.readShared_eq_readCell`, `Reactive.trackedSharedRead_eq_trackedRead`, and `Reactive.trackedSharedRead_registers_edge` formal pins.
- `src/keyed_order.rs` — `KeyedOrder<K, H>`, the graph-agnostic bookkeeping core shared by all three map flavors: present set + authoritative key order, `position`, and the atomic-move algebra (`move_to`/`move_before`/`move_after`, LIS-preserving). Closure-free, context-free, and with no interior mutability — each flavor wraps it in its own `RefCell`/`Mutex` and owns its own reactivity. Mutators report `Mutation::{Changed,Unchanged}` / `Move::{Absent,Unchanged,Reordered}` so the shell decides which signal cells to bump; reactivity deliberately stays out of the core, because a core that faked it with polled counters is exactly lazily-zig's non-reactive map
- `src/cell_family.rs` — `ReactiveMap<K, V, H>` unified keyed reactive collection (`#reactivemap`) over the `MapHandle` trait (`Source` input cells / `Computed` derived cells) + `EntryKind`. `SourceMap<K,V> = ReactiveMap<K,V,Source<V>>` (adds cell-only `set` + eager value-minting `entry`/`entry_with`); `ComputedMap<K,V> = ReactiveMap<K,V,Computed<V>>` (lazy `get_or_insert_with` mint-on-access + eager `materialize_all` pre-mint; no `set`). `MapHandle` is **kept** (not collapsed): its two impls are for the distinct handle structs `Source<V, KeepLatest>` and `Computed<V>`, carrying `const KIND: EntryKind` per kind. No eager/lazy mode flag — eager = pre-mint loop, lazy = mint-on-access
- `src/thread_safe_reactive_family.rs` — `ThreadSafeReactiveMap<K, V, H>` (`#reactivemap`, feature `thread-safe`): the `Send + Sync` flavor over `ThreadSafeContext` (`Arc<Mutex<KeyedOrder>>` present-set state; reactive `keys`/`len`/`contains_key` plus `position`/`move_*`/`remove`) so a keyed map can live in a cross-thread owner; `ThreadSafeMapHandle` trait, `ThreadSafeSourceMap`/`ThreadSafeComputedMap` aliases. Materialization confluence proved in lazily-formal
- `src/async_reactive_family.rs` — `AsyncReactiveMap<K, V, H>` (`#reactivemap`, feature `async`): the `AsyncContext` flavor, with the same `KeyedOrder` core, membership/order plane, and `position`/`move_*`/`remove` surface — ordering is not async-coloured; derived slots resolve asynchronously so `observe` returns `Option<V>` (eventual transparency); `AsyncMapHandle` trait, `AsyncSourceMap`/`AsyncComputedMap` aliases
- **Eager construction** (`#lzcellkernel`, formerly `src/signal.rs`) — an eager `Computed`: `ctx.computed(f).eager()` (or the `ctx.signal(f)` convenience, which builds a guarded computed cell via `computed` and makes it eager) attaches a puller `Effect` that keeps it materialized. `.eager()` is idempotent and returns the *same* handle; `.lazy()` reverses it. Eagerness is graph state — an `eager` bit on `ComputedNode` plus the `eager_by: HashMap<SlotId, SlotId>` side table in `context.rs` (cleared on dispose/lazy) — not a distinct type, so the former `Signal`/`SignalHandle` are retired and the `#lzsignaleager` per-write-puller bug is structurally unwritable. `ThreadSafeContext`/`AsyncContext` keep their own signal handles for now
- `src/async_context.rs` — `AsyncContext` async reactive graph (feature-gated behind `async`)
- `src/thread_safe.rs` — `ThreadSafeContext` mutex-backed shared graph (feature-gated behind `thread-safe` since v0.18.0)
- `src/merge.rs` — RelayCell Phase 1 (`#relaycell`): the `MergePolicy` merge algebra (associative `⊕`, `const COMMUTATIVE`/`IDEMPOTENT` flags) and concrete policies (`KeepLatest`/`Sum`/`Max`/`SetUnion`/`RawFifo`, plus `CrdtJoin<C>` wiring existing `CellCrdt` units behind `distributed`). Under the Cell kernel (`#lzcellkernel`) a "merge cell" is just a `Source<T, M>` with `M ≠ KeepLatest`; the identity `Source ≡ Source<T, KeepLatest>` is a default type parameter, not a spec assertion. The former `MergeCellHandle<T,M>` struct and the `Reactive<T>`/`Source<T>: Reactive<T>` read/write traits are **deleted**. Constructors `Context::source::<M>(v)` (was `merge_cell`) / `Context::apply_merge` (the merge write by id, routes through `set_source`).
- `src/relay.rs` — RelayCell Phase 2 (`#relaycell`): the in-proc `RelayCell<T,M>` conflating relay — hot head (`Option<T>` coalesced under `MergePolicy`), reactive `BackpressurePolicy` (cells: `dimension`/`high_water`/`low_water`/`overflow`), `Overflow` (Block/DropNewest/DropOldest/Conflate/Spill), `IngressOutcome`, demand-driven `depth`/`is_full`/`is_empty` Slots, `ingress`/`drain`. Construction validates overflow vs `M::CONFLATES` (Conflate rejected for RawFifo). Converged egress independent of drain schedule (the `relay_converges` invariant).
- `src/spill.rs` — RelayCell Phase 3 (`#relaycell`): `SpillStore<T,M>` paged durable tail (generalizes `DurableOutbox`) — immutable cold `SpillPage`s (coalesced window summaries), bounded `manifest`, egress cursor, ack-before-reclaim; `SpillMode` (CompactOnWrite/AppendCompact); `reconstruct` (spill_lossless) + `replay_unacked` (idempotent crash-replay).
- `src/relay_roles.rs` — RelayCell Phase 5 (`#relaycell`): `Outbox<T,M>`/`Inbox<T,M>` role facades over `RelayCell` — Outbox backpressures the local producer via `is_full` (default Conflate); Inbox meters the remote via a credit budget (`ready`/`credits`/`receive`/`consume`). A link is Outbox→Transport→Inbox.
- `src/service.rs` — embedded-service plane (`#lzservice`): `HealthCell`/`Core` (composed liveness probe → Healthy/Degraded/Unhealthy, worst component dominates), `ReadinessCell`/`Core` (ready iff all conditions), `DiscoveryCell`/`Core` (service→endpoint keyed by owner peer, membership `evict` removes), `ServiceRegistry`/`Core` (durable log + replayable projection). Pure cores split from reactive cells; composes membership/lease/resilience.
- `src/resilience.rs` — fault-tolerance primitives (`#lzresilience`): `CircuitBreakerCell`/`Core` (Closed/Open/HalfOpen over a sliding failure window, gates `CommandTransport`), `RetryPolicyCell`/`Core` (exponential backoff `min(cap, base·2^attempt)`), `BulkheadCell`/`Core` (bounded isolation pool, `permits_in_use`), `TimeoutCell`/`Core` (deadline fast-fail). Pure cores split from reactive cells projecting state/delay/in_use/is_timed_out.
- `src/windowing.rs` — stream windowing (`#lzwindow`): `TumblingCountCore`/`Window` + `TumblingTimeCore`/`Window` (fixed non-overlapping), `SlidingCore`/`Window` (overlapping fold-recompute), `SessionCore`/`Window` (gap-based sessionization). Window aggregation reuses `MergePolicy` (`Sum`/`Max`/`SetUnion`) — the aggregate is the associative fold of window elements. Pure cores split from reactive cells projecting the last emitted aggregate.
- `src/presence.rs` — presence + ephemeral plane (`#lzpresence`): `Ephemeral`/`Durable` plane markers (durable sink statically rejects ephemeral — compile-fail doctest), `EphemeralCell`/`Core` (single value + auto-expiry), `PresenceCell` (per-peer heartbeat, membership `evict` + TTL) and `AwarenessCell` (last-writer-per-peer cursors/selections) over the shared `EphemeralMapCore`. Reactive cells project the live view/map; invalidate only on a live-view change.
- `src/coordination.rs` — distributed coordination (`#lzcoord`): `LeaseCore`/`LeaseCell` (single-writer authority + monotone fencing token), `LeaderCell`/`LeaderRole` (Leader/Follower/Candidate over a lease), `LockCell` (mutex + fencing `validate`), `SemaphoreCore`/`SemaphoreCell` (bounded permits), `BarrierCore`/`BarrierCell` (wait-for-N, `quorum()` = strict majority). Pure cores split from reactive cells projecting holder/role/is_locked/permits/is_open.
- `src/membership.rs` — membership + failure detection (`#lzmemb`): `PhiAccrual` (Akka-style bit-portable phi over a heartbeat inter-arrival window) + `MembershipCore<P>` SWIM state machine (`PeerState` Alive/Suspect/Dead/Left, `join`/`heartbeat`/`leave`/`tick`, `PeerChangeEvent` diff stream) split from the reactive `MembershipCell<P>` projecting the alive `PeerSet` onto a `Cell<BTreeSet<P>>` (invalidates only on set change). Generic peer id; distributed plane plugs in `PeerId`. Below the CRDT plane.
- `src/rateshape.rs` — rate-shaping source operators (`#lzrateshape`): the lifted `RatePolicy`/`WindowPolicy`/`ExpiryPolicy` (moved out of `relay_policy`; re-exported at crate top-level so relay semantics/API are unchanged) plus source-level operators over any cell handle — `DebounceCell`/`Core` (emit latest after quiet period), `ThrottleCell`/`Core` + `ThrottleEdge` (Leading/Trailing, one emit per window), `SampleCell`/`Core` + `SampleMode` (Count every-nth / Time every-boundary), `ProbabilisticSampleCell`/`Core` + `SampleRng`/`Lcg` (tail sampling `draw < rate`, the plan's only new algorithm). Pure cores split from cells projecting emit onto a `Computed<Option<T>>`; emit-only invalidation.
- `src/relay_policy.rs` — RelayCell Phase 6 (`#relaycell`): `PriorityStorage<T>` (max-priority, FIFO within priority) + `KeyedRelay<K,T,M>` (sharded relays by key). `RatePolicy`/`WindowPolicy`/`ExpiryPolicy` moved to `rateshape` (`#lzrateshape`). Logical-clock time for determinism.
- `src/relay_transport.rs` — RelayCell Phase 4 (`#relaycell`): the `Transport<T>` delivery seam (`deliver`/`poll`/`has_pending`) + `InProcTransport` (direct) and `FramedTransport` (MTU-style framing = CrossThread/Ipc/Ws). The merge algebra, not the transport, guarantees convergence (transport_independent).
- `src/queue.rs` — `QueueCell` (SPSC reactive FIFO + MPSC-via-`batch()` usage rule) + `QueueStorage` adapter trait + `VecDequeStorage` default backend (`#lzqueue`). Reader-kind invalidation (head/len/is_empty/is_full/closed); bounded reactive backpressure via `is_full`; closure lifecycle (drain / Closed-distinct-from-Empty / idempotent+terminal).
- `src/work_queue.rs` — `WorkQueueCell` competing-consumer local authority
  (`#lzworkqueue`): FIFO exclusive claims with stable item/fresh delivery ids,
  worker-owned ack/nack, strict visibility-timeout redelivery, bounded attempts,
  DLQ, and independent pending/in-flight/dead-letter reader kinds.
- `src/topic_core.rs` / `src/work_queue_core.rs` — the graph-agnostic cores every
  queue-family flavor shares (`#lazilythreadsafetopiccel`,
  `#lazilythreadsafeworkqueu`), the same split `keyed_order.rs` makes for the map
  family and for the same reason: the cursor/retention/GC algebra and the
  lease/ack/nack/redelivery/DLQ state machine touch no handle and await nothing.
  **Reactivity is deliberately excluded** — invalidation is a graph write, so
  every mutator returns *which readers changed* (a `Vec` of subscriber ids;
  `Transition::changed() -> ReaderChange`) and each flavor clears exactly that set
  on its own graph. `QueueStorage` already played this role for `QueueCell`
- `src/thread_safe_queue.rs` / `src/thread_safe_topic.rs` /
  `src/thread_safe_work_queue.rs` — the `Send + Sync` flavors (feature
  `thread-safe`). `Arc<Mutex<core>>` storage with invalidation run **outside** the
  lock (a reader's compute takes the context lock then the core lock, so an op
  that invalidated while holding the core inverts the order and deadlocks), and
  multi-root invalidation via `batch()` — `ThreadSafeContext` needs no
  `clear_slots` because `finish_batch` hands every collected root to one
  `clear_frontier_locked`
- `src/async_queue.rs` / `src/async_topic.rs` / `src/async_work_queue.rs` — the
  `AsyncContext` flavors (feature `async`). Reader kinds use
  `AsyncContext::computed` (synchronous compute, async graph), so `len()`,
  `read_stream()` and `pending_len()` return plain values rather than an `Option`
  needing a settle step: **nothing in the queue family is async-coloured**, and
  the work queue's clock stays a caller argument so lease expiry is deterministic
  and fixture-replayable. Multi-root invalidation via `AsyncContext::clear_slots`
- `src/ingress_core.rs` — the graph-agnostic admission algebra behind every
  ingress flavor (`#designimplementtransport`), the same split `topic_core.rs`
  makes for the broadcast family. Keyed lifecycle scopes (Opening/Live/Suspended/
  Closed), a normative admission order (lifecycle → generation fence → freshness →
  handoff → dedupe → ordering → backpressure → merge), a bounded reorder buffer, a
  coalescing hot window under `MergePolicy`, and a bounded three-channel receipt
  log with eviction-stable offsets. **Reactivity is deliberately excluded** — every
  mutator returns `IngressChange`, the set of dirtied reader kinds, and each shell
  clears exactly that set on its own graph. Also carries the `IngressTransport`
  seam and `InProcIngress`: the core never touches a transport, so a WebSocket
  frame, an RPC response, and a polled page are the same input once decoded.
  Freshness enters through an explicit `tick(now)`, so staleness transitions are
  deterministic and fixture-replayable
- `src/ingress.rs` / `src/thread_safe_ingress.rs` / `src/async_ingress.rs` — the
  three flavor shells (`#designimplementtransport`). Four reader kinds per scope
  (`value` / `readiness` / `authority` / `retry`) plus three receipt readers and a
  derived `IngressSchedule`; readiness, authority, and retry are **derives, not
  refresh calls**. The thread-safe shell runs invalidation outside the core lock
  and fans out through `batch()`; the async shell uses `AsyncContext::clear_slots`
  and `AsyncContext::computed` (sync compute, async graph) because **admission is
  not async-coloured** — an admission decision is a function of the fence, the
  watermark, the reorder buffer, and the observed clock, so there is nothing to
  await. Spec: `lazily-spec/docs/transport-ingress.md`; formal:
  `lazily-formal/LazilyFormal/Ingress.lean`
- `src/time.rs` — temporal source primitives (`#lztime`): logical-clock-driven `TimelineSource` cores (`TimerCore`/`IntervalCore`/`CronCore`/`DeadlineCore`) split from thin reactive cells (`TimerCell` single-shot / `IntervalCell` periodic / `CronCell` pattern-periodic / `DeadlineCell<T>` value+deadline → `Deadlined`), plus `ManualClock`. Edge-only reactive invalidation; `BytesPayload` cores (`DeadlineCell` is `PyObjectPayload`). Sets the logical-clock discipline that leases/expiry/windows/presence follow, but those families do NOT compose `DeadlineCore` — their deadlines are re-armable, which `DeadlineCore` (a monotone `TimerCore`) deliberately is not. The only in-tree composition of a temporal core is `stdlib::Timer`.
- `src/state_table.rs` — typed **state tables** (`#lazilystatetable`): a total pure
  `StateTable::decide(&Input) -> Decision` over a *finite product state*, wired as a
  `Computed`. The complement of `state_machine.rs`, not a variant of it —
  `StateMachine` **owns** an accepted sequence of state changes, a `StateTable`
  **derives** a decision from the current product of independently observed facts
  and holds nothing, so replaying the same ordered facts into a fresh `Context`
  reproduces the decision. `projected_state_table` builds **two** guarded cells
  (project, then decide) rather than one: unbounded payloads — hashes, document
  text, revisions — are classified into finite enum axes at the projection
  boundary, and payload churn that leaves the product state unchanged stops there
  and never reaches `decide`. Exhaustive `match` proves the function is *total*;
  it does not prove the table is *reviewed*, so `FiniteState` + `table_coverage`
  produce the Cartesian row set and `TableCoverage` asserts over it — every
  declared decision reached, no row deciding a fall-through, and every assertion
  failing on an empty row set instead of sweeping nothing (`#lzvacuousrun`;
  `assert_at_least(0)` is rejected outright). Impossible combinations are meant to
  be unrepresentable — nest the enum so the axes do not exist, or hand-write
  `FiniteState` to filter through a smart constructor. `thread_safe_*`
  counterparts under `thread-safe`. Plan:
  `tasks/software/plan-lazily-state-tables.md`
- `src/stdlib.rs` — Lazily standard-library conveniences layered over portable primitives rather than added to the graph kernel. `stdlib::Timer` binds logical `TimerCore` to Rust's monotone `Instant`; `Timeout<T>` adds caller-driven operation/cancellation polling, strict monotone deadlines, typed latched outcomes, and deterministic clock/wait seams without owning a future, executor, or thread; `RevisionBarrier` combines monotone revisions with derived predicates, barrier-owned cancellation, `Timer` deadlines, disposal, and application-owned keyed effect receipts while closing check-to-sleep lost wakeups.
- `src/transport.rs` — cross-process zero-copy transport (`#lzzcpy`): `BlobBackend` adapter trait + `InProcessBackend` (wraps `ShmBlobArena`) + `ArrowBackend` (Arrow IPC stream bytes) + `ShmBackend` (POSIX `shm_open`+`mmap`, `shm` feature, Linux) + `spill_message`/`resolve_value` policy + `BlobRouter` multi-backend resolver
- `src/crdt_tree.rs` — `CrdtTree` lossless document contract (`#lzcrdttree`): merge, frontier, delta, empty-frontier snapshot, and materialized value; implemented by `TextCrdt`
- `src/replay.rs` — replay-equivalence proof (`#lzreplayrs`): `ReplayLog` (ordered,
  strictly-increasing, possibly non-contiguous events plus a digest over its
  canonical bytes), `ReplayFingerprint` (per-checkpoint per-cell digests, bound to
  the log digest AND the stride), and `ReplayHarness` (`record` / `check` /
  `verify` / `prove`). `verify` revalidates the log binding BEFORE any value is
  compared — two different logs can settle to the same final values, so a
  value-only comparison would certify a fingerprint that proves nothing about the
  log in front of it. Divergence is localized to the FIRST diverging checkpoint,
  naming the cell label. `ReplayProofError` is an enum so a driver routes on the
  TYPE, not a message: `LogMismatch`, `StrideMismatch`, `Divergence`, `Encoding`.
  **No hash crate.** The spec leaves both the hash and the byte layout
  binding-chosen (fingerprints are pinned beside a test in one language, never
  exchanged), and lazily-rs keeps every dependency optional, so a `ReplayDigest`
  stores the EXACT canonical bytes — at fingerprint sizes the degenerate strongest
  choice, zero collision risk and zero new dependency. What is shared across the
  family is the equality CLASSES, which `canonical_bytes` enforces with a
  type-tagged, length-framed, order-stable encoding over `ReplayValue`;
  `ReplayValue::Opaque` is the residual dynamic case and fails loudly rather than
  degrading to a `Debug` rendering that would embed an address and report a FALSE
  divergence every run. Optional (MAY) row in `coverage.json`
- `src/outbox.rs` — storage-independent durable outbox (`#lzdurableoutbox`): `OutboxStore` ordered-byte boundary, shared `Outbox<S>` append/ack/prune/replay protocol, in-memory backend, and `durable-sqlite` adapter
- `tests/ingress_family_conformance.rs` — the ingress contract
  (`#designimplementtransport`) replayed against **all three flavors** through one
  `IngressModel` trait, over `lazily-spec/conformance/ingress/*.json`: ordered
  delivery, reorder + both duplicate classes, reorder-window overflow,
  disconnect/replay, `Block` backpressure, build-skew generation handoff (including
  the handoff that *buffers*), freshness horizon and retry backoff. `invalidates`
  is asserted per reader kind in **both** directions via a cache-validity probe, so
  over-invalidation is as visible as under-. Carries a three-row ledger enforced by
  grepping `src/` in both directions, plus a mutation-check record of seven probes
- `tests/replay_conformance.rs` — the replay-equivalence contract (`#lzreplayrs`)
  over `lazily-spec/conformance/replay/*.json`: the log binding revalidated before
  any value compare (including the two-logs-same-sum case a value comparison would
  wrongly accept), first-checkpoint divergence localization plus the stride
  binding, and the canonical encoding's equality classes as same/different pairs —
  never a hex digest, which is what leaves the layout binding-chosen. The corpus
  declares its subjects in prose, so `Accumulator` here is this binding's copy of
  that declaration. On a `record` step the fingerprint's `sum` digest is
  cross-checked against the digest of the subject's final state computed WITHOUT
  the harness; without that the fixture would accept a harness that fingerprinted
  some other value entirely, since every other key in the block stays satisfied.
  The encoding test also asserts both outcomes really occurred — a runner that
  only ever saw `false` passes every inequality claim with a broken encoding.
  Mutation-checked in four directions: revalidation neutered (log + stride steps
  redden), the frame's tag and length dropped (the encoding fixture reddens),
  comparison restricted to the final checkpoint (`first_divergent_seq` reports 3
  instead of 1), and the observation shifted off the subject's state (only the
  record cross-check sees it). Dropping only the LENGTH used to stay green here,
  because the corpus's `["a","bc"]` / `["ab","c"]` pair is still separated by the
  type tags. That hole is closed (`#lzreplayframing`): the corpus now carries
  three more `returns: false` rows — `["a","sbc"]`/`["as","bc"]`,
  `{"a":"sb"}`/`{"as":"b"}`, and the NESTED `[["a"],"b"]`/`[["a","b"]]`, the
  fixture's first nested container — and `src/replay.rs`'s
  `framing_pins_the_length_and_not_merely_the_tag` carries the same pairs beside
  the encoder, because the first two are layout-dependent and only the binding
  knows its own bytes. This binding's layout is `<tag><decimal len>:<body>` with
  string tag `b's'`, i.e. the corpus's REFERENCE layout, so the corpus pair is
  also the local pair; a second local pair `["a","s:bc"]` / `["as:","bc"]` pins
  the length DIGITS against the weaker mutant that keeps the `:` terminator.
  Mutation-checked cold in two more directions: `frame` reduced to `<tag><body>`
  (local test and corpus step 8 redden, while the old `["a","bc"]` pair stays
  GREEN) and `frame` reduced to `<tag>:<body>` (the `s:` pair reddens)
- `tests/temporal_conformance.rs` — temporal sources (`#lztime`) compute fixtures (lazily-spec/conformance/temporal/`*.json`); timer single-shot idempotent fire, interval boundary counting under clock jumps, cron pattern matching, deadline expiry preserving value, edge-only reader invalidation
- `tests/common/mod.rs` — the runtime conformance manifest recorder
  (`#lazilyupgradeconformance`). Rust integration tests are separate crates, so
  the seam is a shared `mod common;` rather than a Go-style package-wide helper;
  `common::spec_read_to_string` wraps every fixture read in `tests/` and appends
  the corpus-relative id to `$LAZILY_CONFORMANCE_MANIFEST` (absolute, truncated
  once by `make check`, appended by every test binary). Unset ⇒ no-op, so a bare
  `cargo test` is unaffected. `scripts/check-conformance-coverage.sh` then fails
  on any canonical fixture the suite did not OPEN — and on a missing manifest,
  which is missing evidence rather than evidence of absence. The static grep it
  replaced could not tell a replayed fixture from a hand-transcribed one.
  The same file carries the **per-scenario replay ledger**
  (`#lzscenariocoverage`), the rung above the manifest: a fixture with four
  scenarios of which a runner replays three is green under the manifest alone —
  `reliable-sync/liveness_orset_lww.json` was exactly that, and the key guards
  cannot see it either, because an unreplayed scenario contributes no unconsumed
  and no unasserted key. `common::scenarios` / `scenario_by_name` /
  `scenario_at` hand back a `ScenarioView` that books on the first read of the
  scenario's PAYLOAD (`#lzscenariobodyskip`) — never at the yield, which cannot
  tell a loop body that ran from one that `continue`d, and never at a by-name
  lookup, which walks past every scenario ahead of its match. `id`, `name`,
  `description` and the rest of `SCENARIO_LABEL_KEYS` stay silent, so a dispatch
  chain that reads the label and matches no arm books nothing; `.value()` books
  and hands the whole scenario to a replay helper, `.peek()` is the escape hatch
  that does not. Id resolution is `id`, else `name` — the order every binding
  shares, recorded into `$LAZILY_CONFORMANCE_SCENARIOS`, and the guard script
  compares that ledger with the scenarios each OPENED fixture carries on disk, in
  both directions. The positional `#<n>` fallback is gone (`#lzspecscenarioids`),
  and as of `#recommendedconformanceco` the canonical spelling is settled at
  `id`: every scenario in the corpus carries a unique snake_case one, lazily-spec's
  `scenario-identity-check` requires it, and `name` is demoted to an optional
  human label. So the `name` leg no longer fires for the canonical corpus, and
  `common::scenario_by_id` matches on the resolved id rather than the prose —
  keying a lookup on `name` is the same defect as keying it on position, because
  35 scenarios named themselves with a sentence a copy-edit could reword. The
  excuse list `KNOWN_UNREPLAYED_SCENARIOS` ("fixture|id|reason") sits beside
  `KNOWN_UNCOVERED` so there is one place to read what this binding does not
  prove; it is currently EMPTY — every scenario of every opened fixture is
  replayed.
  The same file carries **RUNG 0**, the assertion-block BIND ledger
  (`#lznullformblind`), which sits BELOW every guard above it. Each of those is
  scoped to blocks a runner already BOUND to the tracker: the unconsumed-key
  guard fires on a key nothing read, the unasserted-key guard on a key read and
  discarded, the prose ledger on a discharge naming nothing. None of them can
  fire for a block **no runner ever bound**, because there is no tracker — its
  keys are not unread, nothing reads them, and the fixture reports exactly
  nothing. lazily-dart found two such blocks carrying eight silent keys, one of
  them the anti-spoof invariant its fixture exists for. So `spec_read_to_string`
  inventories every assertion block at READ time and `Expect::new` books one as
  BOUND, the two sides matched by the block's **CONTENT digest, never by its
  `where` label** — runners spell those labels inconsistently and a label-keyed
  ledger would silently miss the mismatch rather than report it.
  WHAT COUNTS AS A BLOCK (`#lzrsblockwalk`). Every name in
  `{assertions, expect, expect_after, expect_initial, expected}`, at every depth,
  object-valued only, emitted and NOT descended into, with arrays descended
  (`scenarios[3].steps[2].expect` is where most of this corpus's blocks live).
  The walk used to read ONE name at ONE depth and inventoried 36 sites / 30
  digests of the 771 / 661 the same 150 opened fixtures carry — 4.7%. Notably it
  was not missing `assertions` blocks at depth; the whole gap was the four names
  it never looked at (`expected` 434 sites / 359 digests, `expect` 295 / 266,
  `expect_initial` 3 / 3, `expect_after` 3 / 3).
  `$LAZILY_CONFORMANCE_BLOCKS` carries the ledger on the manifest's terms, each
  `bound` line recording the runner's own fixture and label alongside the digest
  (`#lzrunnerownjsonclone`, below). `check-conformance-coverage.sh` fails on any
  inventoried block with no bind, and asserts the inventory's MAGNITUDE because
  zero declared blocks means zero unbound blocks reported OK over nothing. That
  magnitude is not a `MIN_BLOCKS` floor (`#lzblockmagnitudeaudit`): a typed
  number drifts by hand and a `>=` cannot see a shrink that stays above it. It is
  DERIVED from the corpus listing minus this crate's own `KNOWN_UNCOVERED`, on
  TWO dimensions — **771 assertion-block SITES and 661 distinct DIGESTS** — each
  an EQUALITY. Both are needed: a digest count absorbs the deletion of a block
  whose bytes recur elsewhere (167 of the 771 sites carry a recurring shape), and
  a site count absorbs a content edit that collapses two distinct claims into
  one.
  THE BIND-PENDING LEDGER. 570 of the 771 sites are BOUND; the other 201 are in
  `KNOWN_UNBOUND_BLOCKS` as `fixture|where|class|reason`, class from a fixed
  vocabulary (`bind-pending`, `unreachable`), reason REQUIRED. All 201 are
  `bind-pending` and reachable — each is a per-step or per-scenario expectation
  its runner already reads and compares, missing only the routing through
  `Expect`; three step loops (reactive-graph 113, stdlib 54, ingress 28) account
  for 195 of them, and `collections/semtree_incremental.json` for the last 6.
  The ledger is an EQUALITY against the RUN, not a floor: an unbound site missing
  from it FAILS, and an entry for a site the run DID bind — or for a site the
  corpus does not carry — FAILS as stale. A migration therefore cannot land
  without deleting entries, and coverage cannot regress upward without someone
  writing one by hand. There is deliberately no separate typed count beside it.
  Expect the shrinking to be expensive: lazily-kt measured a 100 percent
  higher-rung failure rate on its first migration pass, and two of the three
  blocks bound in this pass hit the same thing (a missing key-set check on an
  object-valued key; a hand-rolled per-runner copy of rung 2).
  A RUNNER'S OWN JSON CLONE (`#lzrunnerownjsonclone`). This binding's loader
  hands runners TEXT, so every runner re-parses and the block a runner binds is
  never the same allocation the loader declared — only ever the same VALUE, and
  the ledger only ever compares digests. lazily-cpp lost 71 sites to a runner
  whose re-parse dropped the raw number token (`"value": 5` digesting as
  `5.000000`), and they read as 71 unrelated coverage gaps. Here the guard
  classifies every bind the loader never declared against every object the corpus
  carries at every depth: 397 such binds, 363 of them below an already-emitted
  block (a sub-object reached with `Expect::sub`, a whole `steps[n]` element) and
  34 matching no corpus object at all — all 34 from `tests/expect_guard.rs`,
  which fabricates `json!` blocks under borrowed fixture names. **Zero clone
  divergences.** Reported, not failed: the self-tests make a non-zero count
  normal. The digest contract itself is pinned by unit tests rather than inferred
  from that number — a runner's own re-parse reproduces the loader's digest, the
  digest SEPARATES `5` from `5.0` (without which the first assertion is satisfied
  by a digest that folds the very divergence it looks for), and `5.0`/`5e0` are
  pinned as FOLDING because `serde_json` normalises both to one `f64` at parse.
  571/771 sites bound or, with the ledger, 771/771 accounted. Validated in ten
  directions: a declared block with no bind FAILS naming it; a stale excuse FAILS
  in both its directions (bound-after-all, and naming no such site); an unknown
  class, an empty reason and a duplicated entry each FAIL; deleting a
  recurring-digest block moves SITES alone; collapsing a unique-digest block
  moves DIGESTS alone; a block respelled to a shape the corpus does not carry
  moves NEITHER cardinality and FAILS the set-identity cross-check; a corpus with
  every tracked block stripped FAILS on the zero-guard rather than passing over
  an empty comparison; an absent ledger FAILS as missing evidence; and the real
  ledger passes.
- `tests/common/expect.rs` — the assertion-key guard
  (`#lzassertunknownkeys`, `#lzconsumednotasserted`), the two rungs below the
  manifest. Rung 2: having OPENED a fixture, did the runner CONSUME the keys it
  asserts? Rung 3: having read a key, did it reach a comparison against the
  fixture's own value? `Expect` wraps one `expected` / `expect` / `assertions`
  block and panics on drop on any of three conditions — a key never read, a key
  read and then discarded, or an excuse the same run made redundant.
  Observational, not declarative: a key becomes **asserted** only by passing
  through `Expect::assert_key` (equality, compared inside the guard),
  `Expect::assert_key_with` (fixture value handed to the caller's own check, for
  tolerances / containment / decode-then-compare), or
  `Expect::assert_key_if_present` (same, for a key that is optional per fixture —
  an absent key carries no obligation, and binding the comparison to presence is
  what stops `if let Some(x) = exp["k"].as_bool()` from consuming a key it never
  compares). `Expect::get` / `Index` still mark a key READ, for a value that
  drives the replay rather than one that is compared, and a read alone is now a
  failure. `Expect::sub` descends into nested assertion blocks (`invalidates`,
  `final_state`) and satisfies the parent key structurally.
  `Expect::excuse_key` (formerly `declared_exception`) marks a key that genuinely
  cannot be compared at this call site, with a required reason; it runs in BOTH
  directions, so excusing a key the same run also asserts fails as a stale
  excuse. Self-tested in `tests/expect_guard.rs`, including one case per
  read-then-discard shape (named skip in a consuming loop, value bound but never
  compared, comparison against a literal).
  Rung 4 is the **prose-key convention** (`#lzprosekeyconvention`), the family's
  answer to a key whose value is an English paragraph. The corpus declares which
  sibling keys those are in `assertions.prose`; a binding MUST NOT decide for
  itself, which is exactly what the nine of us did — four different treatments of
  the same four keys in `blob_backend_discriminator.json` v2, and lazily-rs's was
  `Expect::prose`, a third exempt state that required a reason and then discarded
  it. That method is **deleted**, not given a sibling. A paragraph is now
  DISCHARGED: `exp.prose_key("epoch_disambiguation", &["frame_epoch",
  "blob_epoch"])` names the executable keys that carry its obligation, and
  `expect::verify_prose(fixture)` — armed by a `ProseLedger` guard whose own
  `Drop` fails a run that never verified — checks the naming against what the run
  really asserted. That is the point: "discharged by `frame_epoch`" is a claim
  about the run and can be falsified; "is prose" cannot. Seven failure modes, one
  self-test and one mutation probe each: a declared paragraph asserted, a
  declared paragraph excused, an undeclared key discharged, a discharged set
  differing from `prose`, a discharge naming nothing, a discharge naming a key
  the run never asserted, a discharge naming another paragraph **or `prose`
  itself** — the prose-name set is SEEDED with `prose`, because `prose` never
  self-lists and rule 4's own comparison is what marks it asserted, so without
  the seed a paragraph could be discharged by the declaration that it is a
  paragraph. The DECLARATION and rules 3-4 are block-local; only rule 6/7 name
  matching is **fixture-wide**, because `epoch_disambiguation` is stated in
  `assertions` and discharged by `expect.frame_epoch` / `expect.blob_epoch`,
  asserted long after that block drops. A "run" is ONE TEST: the ledger is
  cleared at each verification, and a claim recorded after one un-verifies it, so
  a discharge in one replay can never be satisfied by an assertion in another.
  `ProseLedger::open` goes FIRST in the test body — Rust drops in reverse
  declaration order, so the teardown net fires after every block check and after
  the explicit `verify_prose`; opening it later inverts that and reports a false
  failure. Two discharges in this corpus are PROXIES and say so at the call site:
  `wire_encoding` is a claim about how the corpus carries its bytes, which no
  assertion a run makes can observe, and `theorem` names a Lean theorem in
  lazily-formal. `note`, `description` and `reason` stay exempt BY NAME wherever
  the block does not declare them prose — the reactive-graph corpus carries ~97
  per-step ones — and the declaration is evaluated on the RAW block FIRST: a
  tracker that subtracts its reserved names before consulting `assertions.prose`
  makes both `frame_roundtrip_*.json` declarations invisible and skips the whole
  convention while still reporting conforming.
  Rung 5 is the **object-valued key-set guard** (`#lzsubblockkeyset`), the same
  defect one level DOWN: an assertion key whose VALUE is a JSON object, compared
  field by field and never by its key set, so a field added upstream is compared
  by nothing while every rung above reports clean — the parent key is read,
  asserted and consumed. Found by the `#lznullformblind` perturbation pass in
  lazily-zig on `arena_blob.json`'s `descriptor`. The fix is in the TRACKER, not
  a per-call-site field count that holds only while every site remembers: three
  entry points satisfy the obligation — `Expect::sub` / `Expect::sub_if_present`
  (descent, the child owns every sub-key, so an unrecognised one is an
  unconsumed key), `Expect::assert_key_set` (the fixture's key set compared in
  BOTH directions against the set the run produced, for a VOCABULARY whose values
  are glosses nothing can compare), and `Expect::assert_key`/`assert_key_at`
  (whole-`Value` equality subsumes key-set equality). `Expect::check` then FAILS
  at drop for any object-valued key consumed through `assert_key_with`,
  `assert_key_if_present` or a bare `get` without one of the three; `excuse_key`
  and `prose_key` stay available and already require a recorded reason. The guard
  is deliberately NOT scoped to top-level `assertions` blocks — it covers every
  block the tracker guards, which is where the defect actually lives: 25 distinct
  block/key shapes across 27 test targets in this suite, `invalidates` most of
  all. Array-valued vocabularies are out of scope (already guarded by set
  difference under `#lzblobbackendstrict`). Both of this binding's top-level
  object-valued keys were covered only BY ACCIDENT before — `descriptor` by a
  `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` attribute on a test-local struct, `outcomes` by
  a hand-rolled set comparison inside a closure the tracker could not see — while
  a key planted inside `queuecell_spsc_push_pop.json`'s `expected.invalidates`
  left the whole suite GREEN. Self-tested in `tests/expect_guard.rs` (opaque
  consumption fails and names the key; descent, key-set and whole-value equality
  each satisfy it; a planted sub-key reddens under each; both set directions;
  array values untouched), and mutation-checked by neutering the descend /
  key-set bookkeeping, which names 25 sites instead of reporting clean
- `tests/state_table_pilot.rs` — the `#lazilystatetable` pilot: Agent Doc's
  retained-document-transition decision as a typed table (Phase 1 — written
  *before* any Agent Doc runtime change, so nothing here reaches into that repo).
  Covers the plan's whole coverage contract: the row set and every decision
  reached, impossible rows unrepresentable (11 constructible of a naive 32), both
  arrival orders for independently propagated facts, replay into a fresh context,
  the effect sink seeing one wake per *distinct* decision, and a successful
  publication settling the table as a fed-back observation rather than an ACK
  gate. Mutation-checked in four directions — collapse the two cells into one,
  drop the decision guard, disable the dominating frontier row, and delete an
  axis variant — each reddens a different test
- `tests/integration.rs` — 13 integration tests
- `tests/spec_compliance.rs` — 68 spec compliance tests
- `tests/conformance.rs` — cross-language IPC fixture round-trip tests (lazily-spec/conformance)
- `tests/codec_roundtrip_conformance.rs` — the frame-codec obligation
  (`#lzmsgpackparity`), over `lazily-spec/conformance/codec/*.json`. protocol.md
  § Frame codecs makes `json` (reference) and `msgpack` (cross-language binary
  default) MUST-level and requires every frame to round-trip through both for
  all three `IpcMessage` variants — a requirement that lived only in prose,
  because all four conformance rungs reason about fixture CONTENT replay and
  content replay never exercises a codec. Each scenario decodes `wire`,
  **re-encodes the decoded message**, decodes again, and asserts against the
  SECOND decode; asserting against the fixture literal would prove nothing. The
  msgpack half also decodes the produced bytes schema-lessly (`rmp_serde` into
  `serde_json::Value`) and pins the external tag plus the SORTED body field
  names, which is the only way to see the named-field rule: a positional encoder
  passes every value assertion and is still non-conforming. Landing this found a
  real defect — `encode_msgpack` used rmp-serde's default `is_human_readable()`
  of `false`, which this crate reads as "positional", so msgpack wrote
  `key: null` where § NodeKey requires it omitted. `IpcMessage::encode_msgpack`/
  `decode_msgpack` now opt in with `.with_human_readable()`. The fixture-level
  block is evaluated AFTER the replay, because `scenario_count` compared against
  `fixture["scenarios"].len()` is the fixture against itself — green over a
  runner that decodes nothing, the exact vacuity `anti_vacuity` exists to name
  (`#lznullformblind`) — and `opaque_node_state_tag` is read off the
  round-tripped node's state rather than written as the literal `"Opaque"`.
  `codec`, `self_describing`, `byte_canonical`, `required_of_binding` and `role`
  stay fixture-versus-literal DELIBERATELY and a self-comparison sweep should
  leave them: they are corpus declarations a binding pins by agreement, not
  facts a run produces — `byte_canonical` states what two conforming bindings
  may do to each other's bytes, which no single run has a comparable value for.
  Three bindings built run-derived versions of these and reverted them.

### Auditing this suite for vacuous assertions (`#lznullformblind`)

Two passes, and the STATIC one is the weaker of the two.

**Corpus perturbation** is the pass that cannot be fooled by how the source
looks: flip every key of every top-level `assertions` block, ONE AT A TIME, in a
SCRATCH COPY of the corpus, and check whether the suite reddens. A key that
stays green when its value changes is not load-bearing however carefully it is
read, typed and referenced — go found three keys gated by their own declared
value, so flipping one to `false` silently retired the rule. Never edit
`lazily-spec` in place: a probe there reddens every other binding concurrently.
Point precompiled test binaries at a scratch sibling instead (`X/lazily-spec`
beside an empty `X/lazily-rs` used only as the process CWD), because every
runner resolves `../lazily-spec/conformance/...` from the crate root. Expected
result: **everything reddens except the keys the corpus declares
`assertions.prose`**, plus `description`/`note`/`reason`/`generator`; anything
else staying green is a finding. Current state: 107 keys, 86 red, 21 green and
all 21 are prose or by-design-uncompared.

**A static detector is guilty until validated.** Three bindings in a row shipped
an audit tool that reported CLEAN over defects it already knew were present.
Run any such pass against `git show HEAD:` / an archive of pre-fix sources FIRST
and confirm it flags the instances you already know about — a detector that
reports zero is indistinguishable from a detector that is broken. The known
traps, all of which have bitten: per-line matching that misses a wrapped
declaration; taint that does not survive rebinding through a loader
(`let (path, fixture) = load(name)`) or through mutation (`set.insert(x)`);
**comment text parsed as identifiers**, so the better-commented a vacuous
assertion is the more certainly it escapes; over-tainting through library calls;
and helper functions laundering taint. State the blind spots rather than
claiming a clean sweep.

Finally, mutation probes need **negative controls that deliberately survive**.
A probe that reddens shows the assertion fires; only reinstating the pre-fix
shape and watching it stay green shows the probe was aimed at the real defect.
  Needs `ipc,ipc-msgpack` (`make test-codec-roundtrip-conformance`); the feature
  is not optional, because an unopened canonical fixture fails
  `conformance-coverage` and a feature flag is not a carve-out
- `tests/blob_backend_discriminator_conformance.rs` — the blob-backend
  discriminator's wire forms (`#lzblobbackendstrict`), over
  `lazily-spec/conformance/codec/blob_backend_discriminator.json` (fixture v2:
  seven forms × two codecs = **14 scenarios**). An OMITTED or NULL `backend`
  MUST decode as `shm` — absence is the forward-compat channel, and the only
  one. A PRESENT value outside `{shm, arrow, in_process}` MUST be rejected
  NAMING the token: every string that does reach `BlobBackendKind::from_str`
  names a backend this build lacks, so normalizing it to `Shm` routes a foreign
  descriptor into the shm arena — the misroute `resolve_wrong_backend` forbids —
  trading a guarantee discharged structurally by routing for one discharged
  probabilistically by a 64-bit checksum. Five of nine bindings normalized, each
  with a written forward-compat rationale. Both halves are checked:
  `error_names_token` separates "refused" from "refused for the stated reason",
  and each accept scenario RE-ENCODES under its own codec and inspects field
  PRESENCE, because rejecting `rdma` and then emitting `backend: "shm"` is a
  conforming decoder with a broken encoder. lazily-rs satisfied the encoder half
  from the field's introduction in v0.25.0 — `skip_serializing_if =
  "BlobBackendKind::is_default"` has been on the field since the day it landed.
  Of v2's four new shapes, three already held (`in_process` since the enum's
  third variant landed; the non-string refusal, which is an ordinary
  `serde_json`/`rmp_serde` type error; and the epoch split, once asserted
  separately). The **null form did not**, and that was a real library defect —
  `#[serde(default)]` supplies the default when the KEY is missing, so a present
  null still reached the enum's `Deserialize` and failed as a type error in both
  codecs. Fixed with a field-level `deserialize_backend_null_as_absent`, which
  branches on `is_human_readable` because a non-self-describing codec writes no
  option tag for this field. Two assertions here are unreachable from a scenario
  count: `backends_decoded` is a SET DIFFERENCE against `assertions.backends`
  (the guard that catches a binding implementing a smaller enum than the clause
  declares), and `frame_epoch`/`blob_epoch` are compared against the Delta and
  the descriptor respectively (v1 carried 9 in both, so one `expect.epoch` could
  not tell the two readings apart). The refusal is carried as the codec's own
  error TYPE, not a string, and the decode runs inside `catch_unwind`, because
  `rejection_is_decode_error` is about the family a caller already guards a
  decode with — a panic refuses the frame past every handler. Nine mutation
  probes, each red on its own assertion. Needs `ipc,ipc-msgpack`
  (`make test-blob-backend-discriminator-conformance`)
- `tests/nodekey_null_leniency_conformance.rs` — `NodeKey` null-leniency on
  decode (`#lzkeynullstrict`), over
  `lazily-spec/conformance/codec/nodekey_null_leniency.json` (two optional-key
  sites × three key forms × two codecs = 12 scenarios). Omit-when-absent binds
  the ENCODER; a decoder MUST read both an omitted `key` and an explicit
  `key: null` as absent, so every scenario also RE-ENCODES the decoded message
  under its own codec and inspects the produced frame for the field, which is
  the half no decode assertion reaches. The runner carries a **raw-wire
  control** (`#lznullformblind`): every key in this fixture's `expect` blocks is
  byte-identical across the `omitted` and `null` families — `decoded_key` is
  null for both by design, because reading an explicit null as absent IS the
  leniency — so post-decode the four `null` scenarios are the four `omitted`
  ones wearing a different id, `#[serde(default)]` collapses them on contact,
  and four scenarios prove nothing while staying invisible to the manifest rung,
  the scenario-replay rung and both assertion-key rungs at once (an unreplayed
  distinction contributes no unconsumed and no unasserted key). Five of nine
  bindings were blind. `wire_key_form` classifies the `key` slot out of the
  `wire_json` TEXT and the `wire_msgpack_hex` BYTES before any decode; because
  that classification runs on the very crates the decode under test runs on and
  so cannot see a defect it shares with them, `raw_key_form` witnesses the same
  slot a second time with NO decoder at all — a text scan for the member name in
  json, and the msgpack `fixstr` field-name header plus the one type-tag byte
  after it (nil = `0xc0`) in msgpack — and the two witnesses are held to each
  other and to the scenario's declared `key_form`, failing closed on an
  unrecognised form rather than defaulting into the lenient branch. The
  fixture-level vocabularies (`codecs`, `fields`, `key_forms`) are asserted as
  SETS against what the replay really dispatched on, and `scenario_count`
  against the scenarios really reached. Proof of the blindness: a corpus whose
  four `null` scenarios carry the `omitted` wires is fully green under the
  pre-control runner and red under this one. Needs `ipc,ipc-msgpack`
- `tests/nodeid_exact_range_conformance.rs` — the `NodeId` exact-representation
  bound (`#lzspecdecoderbound`), over
  `lazily-spec/conformance/codec/nodeid_exact_range.json`. A decoder that cannot
  represent a received identifier exactly MUST reject the frame rather than
  round it; lazily-rs is `u64`-wide, so it asserts the `exact` branch for every
  scenario including `u64::MAX`, and the expectation is compared as a decimal
  STRING because the fixture is itself JSON. `codecs`, `outcomes` and
  `scenario_count` are asserted against what the replay dispatched on
  (`#lznullformblind`). Needs `ipc,ipc-msgpack`
- `tests/collections_family_conformance.rs` — the ordering/independence contract replayed against **all three execution models** (`SourceMap`, `ThreadSafeSourceMap`, `AsyncSourceMap`) via a `MapModel` trait whose only async-coloured method is `settle`. `collections_conformance.rs` covers the single-threaded flavor only, which is how the thread-safe/async ordering gap stayed invisible while `coverage.json` read green
- `tests/collections_conformance.rs` — keyed cell collections compute fixtures (lazily-spec/conformance/collections); value/membership/order independence, atomic move, LIS reconciliation, memoized semantic tree, manufactured text identity, character CRDT convergence
- `tests/materialization_conformance.rs` — `ComputedMap` materialization (`#reactivemap`) compute fixtures (lazily-spec/conformance/materialization/`*.json`); observational transparency eager (pre-mint) vs lazy (`get_or_insert_with`), deferral-not-deallocation present-set monotonicity, entry-kind orthogonal to strategy (input cells always materialized / derived slots deferred under lazy)
- `tests/materialization_threadsafe_conformance.rs` — same materialization fixtures replayed through `ThreadSafeComputedMap` (feature-gated `thread-safe`); proves the `Send + Sync` flavor obeys the shared laws plus materialization confluence (order-independent present set + observed values)
- `tests/materialization_async_conformance.rs` — same materialization fixtures replayed through `AsyncComputedMap` (feature-gated `async`, tokio); present-set laws + eventual transparency (a driven async slot resolves to the canonical value, eager ≡ lazy)
- `tests/relay_examples.rs` — RelayCell Phase 7 (`#relaycell`) example systems as integration tests: §7.2 telemetry pipeline (Sum relay → SpillStore(AppendCompact) → rate-paced batch egress, lossless); §7.4 doc-sync (per-cell KeepLatest KeyedRelay plane converges per cell); §7.1 broadcast (per-subscriber Outbox<KeepLatest> conflation)
- `tests/relay_roles.rs` — RelayCell Phase 5 (`#relaycell`) spike: Outbox state-conflation + Block producer-backpressure; Inbox credit metering; Outbox→Inbox link convergence
- `tests/relay_policy.rs` — RelayCell Phase 6 (`#relaycell`) spike: RatePolicy token bucket; WindowPolicy flush-on-fill/tick + converged-sum preserved; ExpiryPolicy TTL drop; PriorityStorage ordering; KeyedRelay sharding (regression guard for the `#lzrateshape` policy lift — passes unmodified)
- `tests/service_conformance.rs` — embedded-service (`#lzservice`) fixtures (lazily-spec/conformance/service/`*.json`): health aggregation, readiness gating, discovery register/evict, durable registry replay; reader invalidation
- `tests/resilience_conformance.rs` — fault-tolerance (`#lzresilience`) fixtures (lazily-spec/conformance/resilience/`*.json`): circuit-breaker trip/probe/close, retry exponential saturation, bulkhead bounds, timeout deadline edge; reader invalidation
- `tests/windowing_conformance.rs` — stream windowing (`#lzwindow`) fixtures (lazily-spec/conformance/windowing/`*.json`): tumbling count/time, sliding, session windows with Sum aggregate; emit-only invalidation
- `tests/presence_conformance.rs` — presence/ephemeral (`#lzpresence`) fixtures (lazily-spec/conformance/presence/`*.json`): presence heartbeat/evict/TTL, awareness last-writer, ephemeral value expiry; live-view invalidation
- `tests/coordination_conformance.rs` — coordination (`#lzcoord`) fixtures (lazily-spec/conformance/coordination/`*.json`): lease grant/renew/expire + fence monotonicity, leader handover, lock fencing validate, semaphore bounds, quorum majority gate; reader invalidation
- `tests/reactive_graph_conformance.rs` — reactive-graph disposal/teardown (`#lzspecedgeindex`) fixtures (lazily-spec/conformance/reactive-graph/`*.json`), replayed against **all three execution models** (`Context`, `ThreadSafeContext`, `AsyncContext`) via the `GraphModel` trait in `tests/reactive_graph/`: edge detach in both directions, read-after-dispose, churn returns to baseline, recycled-id cleanliness, scope teardown vs the fold of individual disposals, `disarm()`, cross-scope teardown hazard. First executor of that corpus in the family; carries a per-model `KNOWN_DIVERGENCES` ledger asserted in both directions
- `tests/membership_conformance.rs` — membership (`#lzmemb`) lifecycle fixture (lazily-spec/conformance/membership/`*.json`): SWIM join→Alive/heartbeat/leave, phi gap→Suspect→Dead timeout, PeerSet invalidation only on set change
- `tests/rateshape_conformance.rs` — rate-shaping operators (`#lzrateshape`) compute fixtures (lazily-spec/conformance/rateshape/`*.json`): debounce quiet-period emit, throttle leading/trailing, count/time sampling, probabilistic draw<rate; emit-only reader invalidation
- `tests/relay_transport.rs` — RelayCell Phase 4 (`#relaycell`) spike: converged egress independent of transport framing (operational `transport_independent`) across InProc vs Framed at several MTUs, for Sum/Max/KeepLatest; framed transport preserves the op stream
- `tests/relay_spill.rs` — RelayCell Phase 3 (`#relaycell`) spike: `spill_lossless` (reconstruct cold pages + hot = flat fold, both modes); `spill_replay_idempotent` (Max/SetUnion crash-replay converges); CompactOnWrite page bounding; ack-before-reclaim; RelayCell Spill-overflow → SpillStore end-to-end
- `tests/relay_core.rs` — RelayCell Phase 2 (`#relaycell`) spike: converged-egress independent of drain schedule (operational `relay_converges`) across Sum/Max/KeepLatest; Block/DropNewest/DropOldest/Conflate overflow behaviour; reactive `depth`/`is_full`/`is_empty`; construction rejects Conflate for RawFifo
- `tests/merge_conformance.rs` — RelayCell Phase 1 (`#relaycell`) cross-language fixture replay (lazily-spec/conformance/collections/`mergecell_algebra.json`); KeepLatest/Sum/Max per-op converged value + invalidation (idempotent/identity no-op), fixture flags vs policy `const`s
- `tests/merge_laws.rs` — RelayCell Phase 1 (`#relaycell`) property-based law-tests: every `MergePolicy` is associative; commutativity/idempotency asserted per `const` flag (and flag-honesty counterexamples); `Cell ≡ MergeCell<KeepLatest>`, converged-state determinism regardless of op order, idempotent-`⊕` free dedup via the `PartialEq` store-guard, `Reactive`/`Source` supertype uniformity
- `tests/queue_family_conformance.rs` — the queue family's per-flavor gate: all
  eleven canonical fixtures (`queuecell_*` / `topiccell_*` / `workqueue_*`)
  replayed against **all three flavors** through one `TopicModel` /
  `WorkQueueModel` trait, plus a nine-row ledger (3 primitives × 3 flavors)
  enforced by grepping `src/` in both directions so a shipped flavor cannot sit
  unreplayed. Every gate was mutation-checked. Note the topic fixtures were
  previously opened by nothing — `topic_conformance.rs` hand-transcribes the same
  scenarios as Rust asserts, which is coverage that cannot detect drift
- `tests/queue_conformance.rs` — reactive queue (`QueueCell`) compute fixtures (lazily-spec/conformance/collections/`queuecell_*.json`); SPSC total FIFO, popped-head reader-kind independence, MPSC multi-writer inside `batch()`, bounded reactive backpressure (`is_full`), closure lifecycle
- `tests/work_queue_conformance.rs` — canonical `workqueue_*.json` replay:
  exclusive competing delivery, ownership rejection, at-least-once lease
  redelivery, and poison routing to the DLQ
- `tests/seqcrdt_conformance.rs` — move-aware sequence CRDT compute fixture (lazily-spec/conformance/collections/seqcrdt_convergence.json); concurrent-insert/move/value-edit convergence, tombstone commutativity (feature-gated, needs `distributed`)
- `tests/schema_compliance.rs` — lazily-rs serde output validates against lazily-spec JSON Schemas (#lzspecschema)
- `tests/command_conformance.rs` — command/RPC message plane (`command-plane-v1`) fixture replay (lazily-spec/conformance/message-passing); projection reducer + RPC facade terminal-only rule (feature-gated `ipc`)
- `tests/signal.rs` — 19 eager-Signal integration tests (single-threaded + thread-safe)
- `tests/tokio_sync.rs` — 2 Tokio feature-gated sync integration tests (requires `tokio` + `thread-safe`)
- `tests/async_integration.rs` — AsyncContext feature-gated integration tests (incl. eager `signal_async`)

## Key Design Decisions

- **Lazy by default, eager when asked:** Slots mark dirty on invalidation and recompute on access; `ctx.signal()` opts into eager recomputation (guarded computed cell + puller-effect) with no intermediate unset value (`v1 -> v2`)
- **PartialEq guard:** `Cell.set()` only invalidates when value actually changes
- **Guarded computed (`#lzcellkernel`):** every `ctx.computed()` cell is guarded — `T: PartialEq`, and a recompute that yields an equal value keeps downstream caches (no version bump). There is **no unguarded mode**; the former `memo` constructor is retired because `computed` now *is* the guarded form (`slot()` remains the bound-free storage-sense primitive)
- **Dynamic dependencies:** Edges re-discovered on each recomputation (no stale subscriptions)
- **RefCell interior mutability:** Single-threaded by design
- **Explicit thread safety:** `ThreadSafeContext` preserves `Context`'s fast path while adding `Send + Sync` shared graph support

### Benchmark budgets are never "skipped"

`make check` runs `benchmark-evidence` then `benchmark-check`, so the budgets are
measured against the tree in front of you every time. `benchmark-check` on its
own has no skip path and three outcomes:

| exit | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | budgets measured against THIS source tree and green |
| 2 | no evidence — nothing was measured, so nothing can be green |
| 3 | evidence is stale — it measured a different source tree |

Staleness is a content hash (`target/lazily-benchmark-evidence.json`) over
`src/`, `benches/`, `macros/src/`, `examples/instrumentation_profile.rs`, and the
manifests — not an mtime, because `git checkout`, `touch`, and restoring a backup
all move mtimes without any relationship to whether the code changed. Regenerate
with `make benchmark-evidence`; deleting the evidence is not a way to turn a red
budget green.

### Budget ceilings are derived from a measured spread, never typed

Not every instrumentation counter is deterministic, and the gate used to assume
they all were (`#lzbenchbudgetheadroom`). It had the tradeoff exactly backwards:
loose where the counter never varies (`dependency_edge <= 1600` for a counter
that is always 64) and tight where the counter is pure scheduling noise
(`set_cell_invalidation <= 16` for a counter measured from 1 to 256). The second
half is why it flaked on a busy machine, and a gate that reddens on noise trains
everyone to waive the next real regression as a flake.

Each counter now carries an `ObservedSpread` from a real sweep, and its ceiling
is derived from that spread:

| Spread | Class | Ceiling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| zero across idle/loaded/2-core runs | `deterministic` | the observed value, EXACTLY |
| at most half the observed maximum | `scheduling_sensitive` | observed max + one full observed range |
| more than half the observed maximum | `scheduling_dominated` | none — recorded, reported, NOT enforced |

22 of the 51 gated counters are deterministic: they count work items, not
interleavings, and every one held the identical constant on 2 cores and on 32.
Those are where the regression signal lives, and they are enforced with no slack.
19 are scheduling-dominated and carry no signal at all; `benchmark-check` prints
how many it did not enforce, so a green run is never mistaken for full coverage.

Refresh the recording with `make benchmark-spread` (`BUDGET_SPREAD_SAMPLES`
controls the sample count). It prints the measured table, the derived ceilings, a
paste-ready `REGRESSION_BUDGETS` block, and any counter that fell outside its
recorded spread. Take the sweep under the conditions the gate runs in — idle,
loaded, and `taskset -c 0,1` — because a sweep on a quiet machine is how a
0.4 percent headroom budget got written in the first place.

## Benchmark Skill

Use `/lazily-benchmark` to check, update, or run A/B regression workflows for `BENCHMARKS.md`. See [runbooks/lazily-benchmark.md](../../runbooks/lazily-benchmark.md) for the full workflow.

## Code Navigation

Run `tsift status` at session start from the owning repo root. If the task or file lives under a git submodule (for example `src/tsift/...`), switch to that submodule root first so the harness loads the narrower local instructions and repo state instead of the superproject root. `tsift status` repairs the `.tsift/` index state it owns and never rewrites tracked files (`--no-fix` skips even that). If status reports stale or missing instructions, run `tsift init` to refresh the tracked Code Navigation block and runbook; it names every tracked file it rewrites or moves. When the harness cannot perform write commands, ask the user to run the printed `run:` command instead.

Prefer tsift envelopes over raw reads:
- `tsift --envelope search <query>` instead of `grep`/`rg`
- `tsift --envelope source-read <file>` / `tsift --envelope symbol-read <symbol>` instead of raw `cat`/`head`/`tail`/`sed`/`less` source reads
- `tsift --envelope explain <symbol>` and `tsift graph <symbol> --callers` / `--callees` for call graphs
- `tsift diff-digest [path]` (`--pathspec <pathspec>` to preserve scoped reviews) instead of `git diff`, commit-form `git show`, or patch-style `git log`; blob-form `git show <rev>:<path>` stays a raw object read
- `tsift --envelope session-review <path>` / `tsift --envelope context-pack <path>` instead of replaying long session docs or transcripts
- raw-read rewrites route recognized session docs/transcripts to `tsift session-digest --input <path>` and captured logs to `tsift log-digest --input <path>`
- `tsift --envelope digest-runner --kind test|log --path . --shell-command '<command>'` instead of raw test/build output

Command detail lives in [`.agent/runbooks/code-navigation.md`](.agent/runbooks/code-navigation.md) — budgets, `tsift workflow search`, `report.scale_guard` handling, the harness rewrite path for `PreToolUse`-less harnesses, and Codex/OpenCode integration. `tsift init` writes and versions that runbook alongside this block, so it is present in every initialized checkout; read it before broad exploration instead of expanding this block. A repository that also ships a current `.claude/skills/tsift/SKILL.md` should use that skill as the deeper source.

For local verification, run `make check` before committing. After local changes, check the latest GitHub Actions CI run with `gh run list --limit 1` and fix any failing tests before calling the work complete.

Only read full source files when tsift results are insufficient.
